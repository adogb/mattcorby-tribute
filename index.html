					<h4>Creating <em>Telluric</em></h4>
					<p>Corby came back to Sydney from Los Angeles after scrapping a full-length recording of the album. For two years he set to "learn a bunch
					of musical instruments" to be able to create this album exactly like he envisionned it in his mind. Telluric was released in March 2016.</p>

					<h4>At the origin</h4>
					<p>Corby was raised in Oyster Bay, a suburban enclave of Sydney's Sutherland Shire. His first musical memory is 
					being driven past a guitar shop as a five year old and being captivated by the rows of shiny 
					instruments in the window. His dad, John, bought his son a 
					three-quarter acoustic guitar, on which Corby started having one lesson a week. The first 
					song he learned to play was <em>Greensleeves</em>, but his dedication began to wane and singing soon took priority.
					At age 14 he left school, joined a Christian voca group called Iron and Clay and hit the road. During that time
					he met 19-year-old Jarryd James.</p>
					<h4>A big mess</h4>
					<p>Corby later left the group and returned to school. In 2007 he participated to the show <em>Australian Idol</em>. Though Corby
					finished second, for him the whole experience would turn out to be "a big mess". Corby describes the year after <em>Idol</em> as 
					one of the most difficult of his life. Corby felt he had so much to prove. The five EPs he released before his new album <em>Telluric</em>
					were born out of his desperation to prove he was more than an ex-<em>Idol</em> but also as a therapy.</p>
					<h4>Recognition at last</h4>
					<p>In 2011 his song <em>Brother</em> went on to win an ARIA for Song of the Year, and <em>Resolution</em> earned the same award a year later.</p>
